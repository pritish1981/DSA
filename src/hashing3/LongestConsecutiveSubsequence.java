	 * Create an empty hash.
       Insert all array elements to hash.
       Do the following for every element arr[i]
       Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence. To check this, simply look for arr[i] ï¿½ 1 in the hash,
       if not found, then this is the first element of a subsequence.
       If this element is the first element, then count the number of elements in the consecutive starting with this element.
       Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till the last element that can be found.
       If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this
