/**
 * Problem Description:
Given two integer arrays A and B of size N each which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
Also given an integer C which represents knapsack capacity.
Find out the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.
NOTE: You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donï¿½t pick it (0-1 property).

Problem Constraints:
1 <= N <= 500
1 <= C, B[i] <= 106
1 <= A[i] <= 50

Input Format :
First argument is an integer array A of size N denoting the values on N items.
Second argument is an integer array B of size N denoting the weights on N items.
Third argument is an integer C denoting the knapsack capacity.

Output Format:
Return a single integer denoting the maximum value subset of A such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to C.

Example Input :
Input 1:

 A = [6, 10, 12]
 B = [10, 20, 30]
 C = 50
Input 2:

 A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
 B = [12, 13, 15, 19]
 C = 10
 
 Example Output :
 Output 1:  22
 Output 2:  0
